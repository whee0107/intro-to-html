                My name is Linden Wheeler! My favourite meal is a classic Canadian breakfast of over easy eggs, rye toast, sausage, bacon, baked beans, and maybe pancakes if I’m really hungry. I also like Shepard’s pie and my mom’s curry chicken. Apart from food some other things I like are drawing, rock climbing, programming, reading, and crochet.

                I went to Concordia for computer science and did a year and a half in the program. I enjoyed programming for fun but realised I’d rather keep it as a hobby, not a career. I haven’t programmed anything since quitting school, but I’m looking forward to getting back into it!
